A very basic html5 boilerplate project.

Basically [html5 boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) with:
* assets in their own directory
* the addition of bootstrap, jquery, and font-awesome
* a package.json for node package management


It's a good base I use for building on top of for other projects.
