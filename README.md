A very basic html5 boilerplate project.

This is a super simple html5 boiler plate repo.  
It's basically a  slightly rearranged html5 boilerplate with the addition of bootstrap, jquery, and font-awesome.
Its got a package.json for node package management as well.


It's a good base for building on top of for other projects.
